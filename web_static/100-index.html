                    <p>Our place is a private, affordable stand-alone guest house

                        the Fair Grounds(Jazz Fest) and City Park. The guest house is
                        a quaint, 400 square ft. with a full bath, mini kitchen, & living
                        room. The extra high ceilings make the home feel more
                        spacious. The sofa converts to a bed also. We have a hand
                        made counter area that adds character to the room and a
                        great porch/deck to relax on and have a glass of Merlot.

                            <p>Fantastic place. It was clean, Adrienne was great (even though we did
                                not meet in person) and everything went super smooth. Location is also
                                great if you like running and something a bit more quiet. I would suggest
                                a car or take into consideration that you might have to Uber into the city
                                from the location. Overall, would recommend the place anytime.</p>

                            <p>This is a very stylish modern flat on a quiet street in a great location only minutes
                                from all the trendy spots in Shoreditch. Place was spotless. WiFi is good, the terrace
                                is a nice retreat and the rain shower head was appreciated. The concierge is very
                                friendly. A great place, but a few items on our visit: my 20 year old godson wasn't able
                                to sleep well on the thin sofabed. There also wasn't any accomodation for unpacking
                                anything. The flat also had a strong perfumy scent in case you have any sensitivities.
